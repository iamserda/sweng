# Software Development and IT
A Complete Guide To Key Concepts of Software Engineering, Development and Information Technology.

## Programming:
* Programming Language:
    * A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs. 
    * Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), usually defined by a formal language.
    * Source code eventually gets translated(interpreted and/or compiled) Machine Code / Binary which a computer can execute.

## Interpreted vs Compiled Languages:

- **Interpreted Languages: ** Programming languages where code is read line by line during execution. Pros, the code is portable. Con: execution is slow since code is read and executed line by line. Example: JavaScript, Python
- **Compiled Languages:** Languages where the source code is converted into machine code. Once converted, the machine code or executable binary file can be launched and executed without needing the source code again. This is extremely performant.
  * Compilation is cpu and is specific. Therefore, binary executable for an app on a given OS or CPU, say Windows XP 32bit canâ€™t be p
