# Hash Tables

## README for Hash Tables

Hash tables, also known as hash maps, are a type of data structure that stores key-value pairs. They use a hash function to compute an index into an array of slots, from which the desired value can be found. Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique slot, but due to the limitation of any hash function, collisions (where different keys are assigned to the same slot) can occur and need to be handled efficiently. Hash tables are known for their high efficiency in performing search, insert, and delete operations on average, making them highly useful in situations where rapid access to data is required.

### Key Operations
- **Search**: Average O(1), Worst O(n)
- **Insertion**: Average O(1), Worst O(n)
- **Deletion**: Average O(1), Worst O(n)

### Use Cases
- Implementing associative arrays or mappings of unique keys to values.
- Database indexing.
- Caching data for rapid retrieval.

### Python Implementation
Pythonâ€™s standard library provides a built-in `dict` class that implements a hash table. Below is a simple demonstration of using a `dict` to mimic hash table operations:

```python
# Creating a hash table
hash_table = {}

# Inserting key-value pairs into the hash table
hash_table['name'] = 'John Doe'
hash_table['age'] = 30
hash_table['occupation'] = 'Software Engineer'

# Accessing a value by key
print(hash_table['name'])  # Output: John Doe

# Checking if a key exists
if 'age' in hash_table:
    print('Age found:', hash_table['age'])

# Deleting a key-value pair
del hash_table['occupation']

# Iterating through keys and values
for key, value in hash_table.items():
    print(key, ':', value)

# Output:
# name : John Doe
# age : 30
```

### Further Steps
- Explore collision resolution strategies like chaining and open addressing.
- Implement your own hash table to deepen your understanding of its inner workings and collision handling.

Hash tables are incredibly versatile and powerful, offering fast data retrieval times that are crucial for performance-critical applications. If you're ready to move on to the next data structure, Trees, just let me know!
