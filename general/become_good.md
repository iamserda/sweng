Becoming good at coding interviews and solving LeetCode questions is a skill that can be developed with consistent practice, understanding of data structures and algorithms, and refining problem-solving techniques. Here are some steps to help you improve:

1. **Understand the Basics**:
   - Ensure you have a strong grasp of fundamental data structures (like arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming).
   - Familiarize yourself with basic concepts in computer science, such as complexity analysis (time and space complexity).

2. **Consistent Practice**:
   - Regularly solve problems on LeetCode and other coding platforms. Start with easy problems and gradually move to more challenging ones.
   - Aim to solve problems daily or as often as your schedule allows, ensuring a balanced approach across different topics and difficulty levels.

3. **Analyze and Learn**:
   - After solving a problem, or if you're stuck, read through the discussions and solutions provided by others on LeetCode. This can offer insights into different approaches and more optimal solutions.
   - Pay attention to the time and space complexity of solutions and strive to understand how and why certain solutions are more efficient.

4. **Master Problem-Solving Strategies**:
   - Develop a systematic approach to solving problems, such as understanding the problem, devising a plan, implementing the solution, and then testing it.
   - Practice breaking down problems into smaller, manageable components and think of various ways to solve them before coding.

5. **Mock Interviews**:
   - Use platforms that offer mock interviews or practice with peers. This will help you get accustomed to the format of coding interviews and receive feedback on your problem-solving approach.
   - Simulate a real interview environment by explaining your thought process out loud as you solve problems.

6. **Review Core Computer Science Concepts**:
   - Occasionally, revisit core concepts and theories in computer science, as understanding these can often provide deeper insights into solving complex problems.

7. **Stay Curious and Up-to-Date**:
   - Keep learning new algorithms, data structures, and coding techniques. Technology and programming languages evolve, so staying informed can give you an edge.

8. **Build Projects**:
   - Apply your coding skills to real-world projects. This can deepen your understanding of how to apply algorithms and data structures in a practical context.

9. **Take Care of Yourself**:
   - Regular breaks, physical exercise, and a healthy lifestyle can significantly impact your mental performance and resilience during the learning process and interviews.

Consistency, patience, and a proactive approach to learning and problem-solving are key. With dedication and practice, you will see improvement in your coding interview skills and LeetCode performance.
