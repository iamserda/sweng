# Resume as Markdown

Here's an improved version of a resume, formatted in Markdown for clarity and conciseness. I've made several changes to enhance readability, structure, and impact:

1. **Header Section**: Simplified for easier scanning.
2. **Experience Section**: Changed to active voice and quantified achievements.
3. **Education Section**: Streamlined for clarity.
4. **Skills, Awards, and Certificates Section**: Organized for easy readability.
