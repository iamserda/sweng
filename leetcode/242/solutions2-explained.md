# Anagram Checker

Solution1 can be improved for efficiency and simplicity. One common approach is to use just one dictionary instead of two to track the character count differences between the two strings. Hereâ€™s how you could improve it:

### Improved Approach

1. **Use a Single Dictionary**: Track the frequency of each character in the first string (incrementing counts) and then decrement these counts for each character in the second string. If at the end, all counts are zero, the strings are anagrams.
2. **Early Return for Length Mismatch**: If the lengths of the two strings are not the same, they cannot be anagrams. This check can save time before even processing the strings.
3. **Iterate Once Over Each String**: Just like in your solution, but with fewer operations and using only one dictionary to keep track of differences.
4. **Final Check on the Dictionary**: Instead of comparing two dictionaries, you simply check if all counts in the single dictionary have returned to zero.

### Improved Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: Remains $$O(n + m)$$, but with a constant factor improvement because we're only iterating over each string once and performing fewer dictionary operations.
- **Space Complexity**: Improves to $$O(n)$$ (where $$n$$ is the number of distinct characters in the longest string), since only one dictionary is used.

### Improved Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isAnagram(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        # Early return if lengths differ
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        char_count = {}

        # Increment for s, decrement for t
        for i in range(len(s)):
            char_count[s[i]] = char_count.get(s[i], 0) + 1
            char_count[t[i]] = char_count.get(t[i], 0) - 1

        # Check all counts have returned to zero
        for count in char_count.values():
            if count != 0:
                return False

        return True
```

This code is more concise and potentially faster, especially for large strings, as it minimizes the amount of work done to compare the two strings.
