# 700. [700. Search ](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/)
## Description

Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer `val`, return the node in the BST whose value equals `val`. If such a node does not exist, return `null`.

A binary search tree is a binary tree in which for every node, the value of all the nodes in the left subtree is less than the node's value, and the value of all the nodes in the right subtree is greater than the node's value.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

Input: `root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2`  
Output: `[2,1,3]`  
Explanation: The node with value 2 has left child 1 and right child 3.

**Example 2:**

Input: `root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5`  
Output: `null`  
Explanation: There is no node with value 5 in the BST.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 5000]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^7`
- `root` is a binary search tree.
- `val` is guaranteed to be a unique value.
