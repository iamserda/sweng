# 75. [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

## Description

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

Input: `nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]`  
Output: `[0,0,1,1,2,2]`

**Example 2:**

Input: `nums = [2,0,1]`  
Output: `[0,1,2]`

## Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

**Follow-up:**  
Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?
