# [645. Set Mismatch](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch/solutions/4695570/645-set-mismatch/)

## Time Complexity

- What is the time complexity of your solution?
  - O(n log n) because of the TimSort algorithm being used to sort the nums list(aka array).

- Can you improve the time complexity? How?
  - Yes, I could instead use a hashtable to find the duplicate values in O(n). Keys are the elements of the nums list. Indices would be stored within list as the value-pair to each key. Therefore, any list with length more than 1 is the repeated element. I would need to iterate over the dictionary in order to get these values which has an O(n) worst case but it won't increase Time Complexity. O(n) is still better than O(n log n).

- What is the space complexity of your solution?
- Technically O(2n) because we are creating new sets, which boils down to O(n)

- Can you improve the space complexity? How?
- Yes, I learned on LeetCode solutions that
we do not need to use extra time or space on LeetCode.
This can be done in O(1) space using
algebraic reasoning. Instead, one can use mathematical
reasonings to solve this based on the sum of the values
in the set vs the sum of the values that should have been there to find the missing item.

For example, [1,2,2,4] has a sum of 9. 

The sum(set[1,2,2,4]) is 7, so 2 is the repeated value. [2,]

To find the missing value, we need the sum of all values that should be there for a list of len(range(1, len([1,2,2,4])+1)) which is 10 == sum([1,2,3,4]). Now, the sum([1,2,3,4]) aka 10 - sum(set[1,2,2,4]) aka 7 is 3. Therefore we found [2, 3] and return that. Time/Space complexities are CONSTANT!
