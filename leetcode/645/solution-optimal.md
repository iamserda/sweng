# [645. Set Mismatch](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch/solutions/4695570/645-set-mismatch/)

This README outlines an efficient approach to identify both a duplicate and a missing number in a given integer array. Leveraging advanced time and space complexity analysis, this solution stands out for its optimization and practical application in coding challenges, such as those found on LeetCode.

## Overview

The problem at hand involves an integer array where one number appears twice (the duplicate) and one number is missing. The goal is to find both the duplicate and missing numbers in an efficient manner.

## Solution Strategy

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Approach:** O(n log n), due to the reliance on the TimSort algorithm for sorting the `nums` array.
- **Optimized Approach:** Reduced to O(n) by employing a hashtable to identify duplicates. This method involves using each array element as a key and their indices as values in a list. If any key maps to a list of more than one index, it indicates a duplicate. This hashtable traversal maintains an O(n) complexity, offering a significant improvement.

### Space Complexity

- **Initial Approach:** Effectively O(n), as it involves the creation of additional data structures such as sets.
- **Optimized Approach:** Achieves O(1) space complexity by utilizing algebraic solutions that avoid extra data storage. This approach is based on calculating the sum of the elements in the array and comparing it with the expected sum of a unique set of numbers within the same range.

## Implementation Details

The optimized solution employs a mathematical approach to solve the problem with constant space complexity:

1. **Calculate the Actual Sum:** Compute the sum of all elements in the given array.

2. **Identify the Duplicate:** Deduce the duplicate number by comparing the actual sum to the sum of the unique elements in the array.

3. **Find the Missing Number:** Calculate the expected sum of a complete set of unique numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) and identify the missing number by comparing it against the sum of the unique elements.

This method not only simplifies the process but also significantly reduces the computational overhead, making it an ideal solution for large datasets.

## Credits

This solution is inspired by the work of Stefan Pochmann on LeetCode, particularly for problem 645. His innovative use of mathematical principles to minimize time and space complexity is a testament to the power of algorithmic optimization.

## Conclusion

By applying this optimized approach, developers can efficiently tackle problems involving the search for duplicate and missing numbers within an array. This README serves as a guide for implementing a solution that is both time and space-efficient, adhering to best practices in algorithmic design and optimization.
