# Even or Odd

## Description

Given an integer, return True if is an even number, else false. 

A number is deemed an "even" number if it is equally divisible by 2,
meaning when divided by 2 with a remainder is 0. 

Example 4 is an even number because when `4` is divided by `2` we get 0 as remainder.

However 5 is not even because  `5` is divided by `2` 1 as a remainder.

### Tests

```python
assert is_even(-5) is False
assert is_even(4) is True
assert is_odd(-4) is False
assert is_odd(5) is True
```
