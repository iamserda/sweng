Seattle, WA 98109

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer position at Amazon, a company I admire for its customer obsession, innovation, and leadership in cloud computing. With a robust background in developing scalable software solutions and a strong interest in leveraging technology to solve complex problems, I am eager to contribute to Amazon's mission of being Earth's most customer-centric company.

At Accenture, I successfully led several projects, including the deployment of microservices and the development of a large-scale analytics service. These projects not only sharpened my technical skills but also reinforced my ability to work collaboratively in fast-paced environments, driving significant improvements in operational efficiency and product innovation.

Amazon's pioneering work in cloud computing, e-commerce, and AI, combined with its commitment to sustainability and positive global impact, is incredibly inspiring. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work on Amazon Web Services (AWS) projects, contributing to the development of services that empower businesses and developers to build scalable applications.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of joining Amazon and look forward to discussing how my skills, experience, and passion for technology can contribute to your team's goals and initiatives.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
