Hiring Manager
Etsy
117 Adams Street
Brooklyn, NY 11201

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer position at Etsy, a platform that champions creativity, craftsmanship, and the spirit of entrepreneurship. My background in software engineering, with a particular focus on developing e-commerce platforms that prioritize user engagement and seller success, aligns with Etsy's mission to "Keep Commerce Human."

At Accenture, I was involved in several projects that enhanced the digital presence and operational efficiency of our clients, including developing scalable web applications and implementing comprehensive analytics solutions. These experiences have honed my ability to create software solutions that are not only technically robust but also deeply focused on providing value to users and stakeholders.

Etsy's dedication to sustainability, diversity, and supporting small businesses is inspiring. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to contribute to Etsy's platform, using my skills in Python, Django, and React.js to create features that empower sellers and enrich the buyer experience.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how my technical expertise and passion for creating impactful, community-driven platforms can contribute to the continued growth and success of Etsy.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
