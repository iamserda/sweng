Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer position at Netflix, a company at the forefront of entertainment innovation. My background in software development, particularly in creating scalable, high-performance applications, aligns with Netflix's commitment to delivering exceptional streaming experiences to millions of users worldwide.

These experiences have prepared me to tackle the challenges of developing software that supports Netflix's complex, data-driven decision-making processes and its global content delivery network.

Netflix's culture of freedom and responsibility, its emphasis on innovation, and its dedication to diversity and inclusion resonate with my professional values and aspirations. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the team that continuously pushes the boundaries of what is possible in the streaming space.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how my technical skills, passion for technology, and creativity can contribute to achieving Netflix's ambitious goals.

Sincerely,
