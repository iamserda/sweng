Los Gatos, CA

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the [Specific Job Title] position listed on the Netflix Careers page. With a rich background in software engineering, especially in backend DevOps and full-stack development at Accenture, and a keen interest in media and technology, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Netflix's innovative projects that continue to redefine the entertainment landscape.

At Accenture, I spearheaded the containerization of microservices for a leading banking client, deploying these to a global Docker registry. This initiative not only streamlined operations but also enabled compliance with national data policies across teams in Asia, Europe, and the US. My work reduced the codebase by 15%, highlighting my commitment to efficiency and excellence. On another project, I led the development of a monolith analytics service, directly impacting over a thousand executives and managers by providing vital, dynamic updates on cost-related data and analytics. This project, built with Django and SQL and deployed on Redhat Openshift, honed my skills in creating robust, scalable solutions that deliver real value.

My freelance experience, including creating an optimized UI for ExploreAPI with over 1000 components and developing Moovee.app, a movie search engine, further showcases my ability to deliver user-centered digital solutions. These projects underscore my proficiency in React.js and my passion for creating engaging, intuitive user experiences.

I hold a BBA in Information Systems from Baruch College, where I deepened my expertise in data analytics, web applications, and agile project management. This educational background, combined with my professional experience, has equipped me with a strong foundation in both the technical and strategic aspects of software development in fast-paced, innovative environments.

Netflix's commitment to innovation, diversity, and storytelling resonates with my professional aspirations and personal values. I am particularly drawn to Netflix's culture of freedom and responsibility, which I believe fosters creativity and breakthrough innovations. I am eager to bring my background in software engineering, my passion for problem-solving, and my drive for continuous learning to the Netflix team, where I hope to contribute to the development of groundbreaking features and services.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills, experience, and interests align with the needs of Netflix. I am available at your convenience for an interview and can be reached at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email].

Warmest regards,

[Your Name]
