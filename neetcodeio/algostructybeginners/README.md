# [Algorithms and Data Structures for Beginners](https://neetcode.io/courses/dsa-for-beginners/0) by [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io)

Introduction
TLDR: This course covers the majority of data structures & algorithms (DSA) topics required to succeed in technical interviews. For more advanced topics, please see the Advanced Algorithms course.
In technical interviews, candidates are expected to code an efficient algorithm, and comfortably discuss tradeoffs of that algorithm.

It may not be fair, but being good at coding interviews can mean the difference between landing your first job or not. It can be a difference of tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in extra compensation.

Whether the time invested is worth it is up to you. This is just how the game is played today, for better or worse.

Who is this course for?
You should have basic knowledge of at least one of the following programming languages to get the most out of this course:

Python
Java
C++
JavaScript
C#
This course is designed specifically for you if any of the following apply:

You are completely new to data structures & algorithms (DSA).
You previously learned DSA but need a refresher.
You are preparing for technical interviews.
What's included in this course?
This course is designed for all learning styles. It includes:

34 video lectures
34 written articles with code snippets
63 coding exercises with video solutions
85 animations
77 images and diagrams
Topics Covered
The course covers the following topics, which have been arranged deliberately in a specific order to facilitate progressive learning.

Arrays
Linked Lists
Recursion
Sorting
Binary Search
Trees
Backtracking
Heap / Priority Queue
Hashing
Graphs
Dynamic Programming
Bit Manipulation
As you progress through the course, you'll be able to leverage earlier knowledge to draw connections and deepen your understanding.

For more topics, please see the Advanced Algorithms course.

What makes this course different?
Many courses taught at universities focus way too much on theory and not enough on actually preparing you for interviews. Many students will take a university algorithms course and still struggle to implement simple algorithms.

Here are a few ways we are fixing that:

Interview Focused: We focus on the practical implementation of DSA. Sure, implementing a red-black tree from scratch is cool, but you would be better off practicing more common concepts.

Active Learning: The best way to learn is not to read books or listen to lectures. It's to actively practice and solve problems. You will spend most of your time in this course practicing. You can even practice without leaving the site.

Progressive Learning: Have you ever had a class where you were presented a new concept, but you didn't have the prerequisite knowledge to understand it? Well we do the opposite. We made it easy for you to learn, by arranging the topics in a very specific order so you can continuously build on your knowledge.
